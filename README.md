# Collaborative Mental Health Initiative
Collaborative Mental Health Web Application Project

## Vision
Mental Health for all

## Background
1 of 3 individual would suffer from mental health at their point in life. Either temporarily, long-term or permanent. It is a problem too big to be solved by individual practitioner, government, or software provider. Therefore we feel that open source development of collaborative platform will provide an aid for practitioners to help patient with mental health, so everyone is literally on the same page.

## Goal
Our goal is to develop an aid to help health care practitioners collaborate with each other to help patient with mental health issue. This source code will be a result of collaboration between clinical and technical input from collaborators. As it's an open source project, it is free for download, free for commercial use and free for use by anyone.
